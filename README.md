# Pac-Man AI Search
Focused on foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. Implemented AI utilizes DFS, BFS, uniform cost, A*, reinforcement learning algorithms to solve various scenarios in pseudo-random, multi-agent adversarial environments. 

### -Search
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### -Multi-Agent Search
Developed multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

### -Reinforcement Learning
Designed model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbookâ€™s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

### -BNs and HMMs: Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

### -Machine Learning: Classification
Implemented the perceptron algorithm and neural network models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification.
