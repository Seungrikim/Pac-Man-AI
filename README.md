# Pac-Man AI Search
Focused on foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. Implemented AI utilizes DFS, BFS, uniform cost, A*, reinforcement learning algorithms to solve various scenarios in pseudo-random, multi-agent adversarial environments. 

## Search
Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
